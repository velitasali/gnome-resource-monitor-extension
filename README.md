# Resource Monitor

This is a GNOME Shell extension that shows the status of system resources in a similar fashion to [system-monitor](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet) with a more simple approach.

## Which resources?

* RAM Usage

## Plans for further development

Right now, I don't have plans for adding settings or different system resources, however, the latter can be worked on as the extension was appropriately named to enable such scenerios.
